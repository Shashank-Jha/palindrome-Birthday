# Birthdate Palindrome Check

### About App:

This is a fun app, to check if a date is palindrome or not

- This app checks your birthdate in 6 formats yyyy-mm-dd, dd-mm-yyyy, mm-dd-yyyy, dd-mm-yy, mm-dd-yy, yy-mm-dd e.g. if your birthdate is 01 Aug 1995, then app will check for 01081995, 08011995, 010895, 080195, 950801.
- It will show date is palindrome if one of the combinations is palindrome.
- If the date is not palindrome then it will show nearest date and by how many days it got missed.

### Bonus

I have also implemented a loader when the results are being calculated.
